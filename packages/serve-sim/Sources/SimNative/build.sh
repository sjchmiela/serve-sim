# Builds serve-sim-native.node — the in-process N-API addon that replaces the
# spawned serve-sim-bin helper. The JS bindings are written in Swift with
# node-swift (see ../../Package.swift and sim-module.swift).
#
# Host-arch only (arm64 on Apple Silicon / CI). We use a plain `swift build`,
# i.e. the NATIVE SwiftPM build system, because that is the only mode that
# resolves node-swift's #NodeModule macro plugin: both `--arch X --arch Y`
# (universal) and `--triple <other-arch>` force Xcode's XCBuild, which fails to
# resolve the NodeAPIMacros plugin on stock toolchains ("missing target
# NodeAPIMacros" / "unable to resolve module SwiftSyntax"). Cross-compiling the
# x86_64 slice would therefore require an x86_64-native toolchain (Rosetta),
# which isn't available everywhere; serve-sim targets Apple Silicon. napi_* stay
# undefined and resolve against the host (Node/Bun) at dlopen via
# `-undefined dynamic_lookup`.
